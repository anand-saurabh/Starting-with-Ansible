# Starting-with-Ansible.

![](images/snip1.JPG)

This is a basic ansible script which I created for my local system (windows). To run this ansible playbook (site.yml file) use the standard 
ansible playbook command with the inventory file "inventory".
Go to the source code directory and run the following command:
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml.

Refer to screenshot attached above. The command successfuly executes the ansible playbook.
